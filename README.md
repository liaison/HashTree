# HashTree
A data structure that combines the hash and the tree, to have both of their advantages.
i.e. 
 - random acccess in O(1) of hash table.
 - retrieve the minimal element in O(1).
 - insertion and deletion in O(logN), in contract to O(1) of hash table. This is a small price to pay, to have the above two benefits.
